## Vendored third-party licenses

<a id="vendor-libmobile"></a>
### libmobile (vendored)

Used by:
- `vendor/libmobile-0.2.2` (compiled when the `bundled` feature is used)

Libmobile is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3 (LGPL-3.0-or-later).

License texts:
- `vendor/libmobile-0.2.2/COPYING.LESSER` (LGPL-3.0)
- `vendor/libmobile-0.2.2/COPYING` (GPL-3.0)

If you distribute binaries that include the vendored `libmobile`, you must comply with LGPL obligations. This typically means providing the corresponding source (the vendored `vendor/` copy is one way to satisfy this) and ensuring users can relink against a modified version of libmobile, as required by the license.

For the authoritative license texts see:

<a id="vendor-imgui-wgpu"></a>
### imgui-wgpu (vendored)

Used by:
- `vendor/imgui-wgpu-0.24.0`
